# SURE: SUccinct REpresentation of cells
 SURE introduces a vector quantization-based probabilistic generative model for calling metacells and use them as landmarks that form a coordinate system for cell ID. Analyzing single-cell omics data in a manner analogous to reference genome-based genomic analysis.

## **$$\color{red}\text{\textbf{UPDATE}}$$**
An update has been distributed. Users can access to it via [SUREv2](https://github.com/ZengFLab/SUREv2). It provides Python classes that users can call SURE in scripts. It also provide the command that users can run SURE in the shell. Additionally, SUREv2 supports the calling of metacells for multi-omics datasets.

## Installation
1. Download SURE and enter the directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZengFLab/SURE.git && cd SURE
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

3. Activate the created environment. 
```bash
conda activate SURE
```

4. Install SURE
```bash
pip install .
```

5. Test whether SURE has been installed
- Test the metacell command for single omics data
    ```bash
    SURE --help
    ```
