# SURE: SUccinct REpresentation of cells
 SURE introduces a vector quantization-based probabilistic generative model for calling metacells and use them as landmarks that form a coordinate system for cell ID.


## Installation
1. Install [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) according to your computational platform
2. Install dependencies:
    - `pip3 install numpy scipy pandas scikit-learn pyro-ppl matplotlib`

    - `pip install datatable`


## Example 1: Calling metacells for a single-cell dataset
